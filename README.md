# Travel Shop App

Travel Shop App is a full-stack project that lets user search, view, upload, select, and purchase travel plans.

This is created based on the [MERN Project tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaWtIkJgah4&list=WL&index=4&t=0s) with some modifications. 

Download the repo and `yarn run dev` will start the back and front end.
By default, the back end runs on port 5000 and the front end runs on port 3000.

## What does the app do
This app currently has the following features:
1. Search travel package products by search terms or continent and price filters. 
2. Upload travel products, associated images and descriptions.
3. Select products and edit carts.
4. Make payment through PayPal. Try with a [sandbox account](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/accounts/).
5. View purchase history.
